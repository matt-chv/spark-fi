For years his dreamed where filled of humans with shiny metallic but did not know their names. 
Until one day he found a very old parchement with blood writing in the margins

"Though shall not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
Though must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
Though must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law."

He woke-up screaming from his dream, screaming "robots" until his mother came
"Isaac, are you alright"
