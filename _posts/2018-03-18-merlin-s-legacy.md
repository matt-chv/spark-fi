# Science, Merlin's true legacy

As soon as Merlin held the Holy Grail, he knew that the Age of Magic had rea    ched an end.

Merlin's first experiments drew immediate attention from astrologers, alchem    ists and their crowds. As the experiments grew more and more powerful, a reb    ellion formed led by the Lady of the Lake. Soon enough Camelot was under sie    ge.

Pressed for time, Merlin took a first sip from the cup to divert the energy     of planets and stars from astrologers to Gallileo and his heirs. Exhausted f    rom this and hit by a charm he started drinking a second sip, transposing th    e energy of lighting and metals from alchemists to Newton and his scions. Be    fore being done, as the gates of his laboratory were shaking under the assau    lts of the queen of magic. Merlin had no choice but to stop the transfer and     send the calice into hidding.

To this day the heirs of Vivianne, though now powerless, are looking for the     Holy Grail and scientists wonder why science can be so clear for everything     except quantum physics.
