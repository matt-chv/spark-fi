Romeo loved Juliette and so did she.

But she lived in a planet licated within the higher dimensions of the solar system.

They had met as they had bot APed and kept in meeting there as soon as their mentors went asleep.

But however strong their love, they could not challenge the established order which had put planets in some random dimensions amongst the different 11 possible. 

Astronomers on each of their respective planet could feel the masses of the other planets. some called them dark matter and others heaven, but none could see each other out of AP.
